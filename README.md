## A Personal Profile For Prospective Employers

In this project, I intend to ceate a website which promotes me as a professional.  I hope to present a clean, easy to navigate, platform which will: 
- Give a brief introduction
- Convey key information about me and my professional skills
- Provide an easily-accessible link to my CV in PDF format
- Display a few basic projects that I have worked on
- Provide links to social-networking/github profiles

**The main objective of the application is to portray myself in a professional manner and enable potential employers easy access to my credentials.**
